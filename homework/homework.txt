Given the 6-week period for the application improvement, 3 sprints with 2 weeks in each sprint can be planned for the works.

1st sprint will be focused on initial look up performance improvement & the favorite widgets importing interface update design
- As the DBRepo.FindByZip query took near 42% of the LocationController#find time with 6 queries totally, work on fine tuning 
  the query to improve the average query time & finding potential opportunity to reduce the number of queries used.
- There is about 50% of LocationController#find time is spent somewhere else other than database queries, work on profiling
  the remaining time to identify potential opportunities for improvements.
- Work on profiling the IntegrationController#lookup with details on query time, number of queries, and time spent outside queries, to
  identify potential opportunities for improvements.
- Design the widget importing interface update to include the feedback about import process in the response payload.

2nd sprint will be focused on user validation of the initial performance improvement, further performance improvements implementation,
and widget importing interface update implementation
- When permitted by the deployment window, deploy the initial performance improvement, and collect user feedbacks for validation.
- Implement further performance improvements based on profiling results from 1st sprint.
- Implement the updated widget importing interface with widget import feedback in the response payload.

3rd spring will be focused on internal and user validation of the performance improvements & interface enhancement
- When permitted by the deployment window, deploy all updates from 2nd sprint.
- Run internal validation on performance improvements & new widget importing interface.
- Collect user feedback on the performance improvements & interface enhancement.
- Wrap up the works with internal testing report & user feedback addressed.
